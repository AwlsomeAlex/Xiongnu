# StarInit (StarLinux Init Scripts)
StarInit is a series of Boot Scripts I used to initiate AwlsomeLinux and will use for StarLinux instead of having it held in one central Repository. These scripts should be compatible with other Minimal Linux Live Projects as long as they have Kernel Headers/Modules built during compiling.

## What's Included:
* Required Boot Directories Created at Boot
* OverlayFS Mounter
* /dev Occupier
* Network Initiator
* EXPERIMENTAL: Pivot Root Switcher

## Contributors:
* Ivandavidov (Original Boot Scripts)
* AwlsomeAlex (Rewritten Boot Scripts)
