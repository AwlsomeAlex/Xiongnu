# MuroINIT (StarLinux's sysV-like Init Scripts)
MuroINIT started as starINIT, which was heavily based off of the init scripts used by Minimal Linux Live, but after being exposed to its OverlayFS, I wanted to find a more traditional way of storing files. So after looking at several Linux Distribution's init files (Devuan, Gentoo, etc.) I rewrote it in a similar fashion to the current itteration of MuroINIT (previously Xiongnu) found today. StelaLinux and its various componients have been rewritten dozens of times, but I hope to keep this one stable.

## What (will be) included:
* Required Root (/) Directories
* /dev Occupation
* (minimal) Networking and DHCP

## Contributors:
* AwlsomeAlex (Developer)
* Gentoo Linux (Boot Script Concepts)
